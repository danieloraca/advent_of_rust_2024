⚠️ Important Note
We use clone() in this example, but we are not claiming it is the optimal approach. The goal here is to present a solution that helps illustrate Rust's ownership system in a simple way. As the story unfolds in the next challenge, we'll dive into more efficient patterns. This example is intentionally simplified for the sake of education and storytelling.

Enjoy!
